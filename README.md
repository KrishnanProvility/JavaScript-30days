## Introduction

The JavaScript 30-Day Challenge is designed to help developers build 30 different projects using vanilla JavaScript, without relying on frameworks or libraries. This repository documents my journey through the challenge, showcasing the projects I've completed and the lessons learned along the way.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into directories for each day of the challenge:

```


Day 1 => simple exercise like console.log etc.... [https://github.com/KrishnanProvility/JavaScript-30days/tree/main/Day1]  (Day 1)

## Completed Days
